> Roadmap to becoming a full stack .net developer in 2021

Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become a .net backend developer. I made these charts inspired from https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap for sharing my knowlegdge with others and learn form others.

If you think that these can be improved in anyway, please do suggest.
